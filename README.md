1. What is the importance of data visualization?
Data visualization helps transform raw data into meaningful insights. It makes it easier to understand trends, patterns, and outliers by representing data visually, which improves decision-making and communication, especially for non-technical audiences.

2. When do you use a pie chart vs bar chart?
Pie Chart is used to show proportions or percentages of a whole (e.g., market share, sales by region).
Bar Chart is used to compare values across categories (e.g., sales by product, customer count by store).
If you're comparing more than 5 categories or exact values matter, bar charts are usually a better choice.

4. How do you make visualizations more engaging?
-Use clear titles and labels.
-Choose the right chart type for the data.
-Apply color coding for easy interpretation.
-Use interactive elements like slicers or tooltips in Power BI.
-Highlight key insights (e.g., top-performing stores).

4. What is data storytelling?
Data storytelling combines data, visuals, and narrative to explain insights and drive action. It’s not just about charts — it's about presenting the why behind the data, showing impact, and making the analysis relatable for the audience.

5. How do you avoid misleading visualizations?
-Use a consistent scale and avoid manipulating axes.
-Don’t cherry-pick data — show the full context.
-Label everything clearly.
-Avoid using 3D charts or excessive decoration that may distort understanding.
-Always focus on accuracy over aesthetics.

6. What are best practices in dashboard design?
-Keep it clean and minimal.
-Prioritize the most important metrics (KPIs).
-Use consistent formatting (fonts, colors, layout).
-Make it interactive (filters, slicers).
-Group related visuals and limit distractions.
-Design for the end user — know what they care about.

7. What tools have you used for visualization?
I've worked with:
Power BI – for dashboards, interactive reports, and data transformation.
Excel – for quick charts and pivot tables.
(Optional: If applicable) Tableau, Google Data Studio, or Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for code-based visualizations.
